# Employee Attrition Prediction - ML Mini Project

### Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to analyze employee-related data to build a predictive model that classifies whether an employee is likely to leave the organization. This will assist Human Resource departments in identifying key factors influencing attrition and taking proactive measures to retain valuable talent.

## üìå Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to use machine learning to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on various features such as age, job role, income, satisfaction level, and more.

## üß† Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Selection
- Model Training and Testing
- Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Comparison of multiple classifiers

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used contains features relevant to employee demographics, job roles, performance, and attrition. It is assumed to be included within the notebook or linked through a `data` directory.

## üèÅ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/tanishqrajpuria/employee-ml-project.git](https://github.com/tanishqrajpuria/ML_MiniProject.git)

cd employee-ml-project

2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook EmployeeMiniProject.ipynb

# ‚úÖ Results
The project evaluates multiple machine learning models and selects the best-performing one based on key evaluation metrics. Visualizations are included to help understand both the data and model performance.

# üì¨ Conclusion:
 
1. Job Level: Lower Job Levels are highly probable to quit. This can imply that entry-level workers do not feel secure or satisfied with their work.
 
2. Monthly Income: The lower the Monthly Income, the higher the likelihood of quitting. Maybe poor pay equates to lousy recognition of efforts; this would demotivate people from continuing to work.
 
3. Years at Company: The more years the employee has spent in a Company, the more likely he is to leave. Perhaps new employees are still experimenting with other ways and don't really want to be committed to that organization.
 
4. Total Working Years: More or less Total Working Years usually makes an employee leave the company. Long-service employees may be highly bonded to the job they're working in.
 
5. Business Travel: The employees who travel very often may have a high chance of leaving the organization, while employees with low travel responsibilities will have the least chances of leaving the organization due to a burning out or work-life balance.
 
6. Department: Employees in the Research & Development department are reported to leave the organization less compared to those in other departments, which suggests a more satisfactory working environment or better organizational backing.
 
7. Education Field: Those holding degrees in Human Resources and Technical fields are most likely to leave. This may be because of different job satisfaction levels or advancement opportunities.
 
8. Gender: The likelihood of leaving is higher among males than females, possibly pointing toward gender issues in the workplace.
 
9. Job Role: Laboratory Technician, Sales Representative, and Human Resources are the most likely to leave the organization compared to other roles.
 
10. Marital Status: Single employees are more likely to leave than Married or Divorced employees, which could be a reflection of lifestyle choices and career exploration.
 
11. Overtime: Employees who regularly face the problem of working overtime have a higher chances of experiencing turnover, where the underlying reasons may involve increased stress or dissatisfaction by overworked employees.
 
This is knowledge organizations can use when implementing retention-specific strategies or increasing the satisfaction of these employees.
