## 📌 Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to use machine learning to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company based on various features such as age, job role, income, satisfaction level, and more.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ Features

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Selection
- Model Training and Testing
- Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Comparison of multiple classifiers

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used contains features relevant to employee demographics, job roles, performance, and attrition. It is assumed to be included within the notebook or linked through a `data` directory.

## 🏁 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/tanishqrajpuria/employee-ml-project.git](https://github.com/tanishqrajpuria/ML_MiniProject.git)

cd employee-ml-project

2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook EmployeeMiniProject.ipynb

# ✅ Results
The project evaluates multiple machine learning models and selects the best-performing one based on key evaluation metrics. Visualizations are included to help understand both the data and model performance.
